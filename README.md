QuadraticProblemExample2
========================

These are the example codes for Quadratic Problem optimization by Levenberg-Marquardt method by Apache Commons Math (API 3.4).

Most of the part of source codes are derived and modified from the user guide of [Apache Commons Math - 12 Optimization-]
(http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/userguide/optimization.html).

Thank you.
